# Electric-Load-Forecasting-Using-Seq2Seq-with-Attention

This work presents a novel deep neural network for short-term electric load forecasting for the St. John’s campus of Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN). The electric load data is ob-tained from the Memorial University of Newfoundland and it is combined with metrological data of St. John’s. This is used to formulate a multivariate time-series forecasting problem. A novel deep learning algorithm is presented consisting of a 1D Convolutional Neural Network which is followed by an Encoder Decoder Based Network with attention. The input used for this model is the electric load consumption and metrological data while the output is the hourly prediction of the next day.
